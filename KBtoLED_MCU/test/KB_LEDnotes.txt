counter increases which means that it is reading that clock is changing,
wait for clock to go low, read data, increment count, wait for clock to go high
clock goes low, reads data, data is 1, data stays at 1 even though actual signal changes
data stays high, does not go low
counter implies that its reading the clock, but when we output the reading on the clock pin..
clk pin starts high, then goes low and stays low, even though clk pin goes back up to high
after key press
On the other hand data stays high
Send LED array
-need to figure out which pin is load, which pin is MOSI, which pin is SCK. Then check on oscilloscope.
-load pin is PB5 (testSPI.c)
-SCK is PA5 (going to need to change pin for keyboard)
-PA7 is MOSI 
In addition to array being sent, array needs to be constantly 
sent while processing, and then processing needs to be interrupted by
keyboard and that gets sent to array
So next step is sending array while processing
